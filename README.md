# # BrainF**k Visual Editor

## ## Requirements
C# configured properly

## ## Description
BrainF**k is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), or a joke language. I was inspired by Tsoding and his Tula Language/Mathematics animation tool, so you will see a lot of similarities to it. Otherwise I just wrote it on a whim. 

## ## How to use
I tried making the Editor as easily acessible as possible, but it does have a few kinks.
To start writing BrainF**k, from now on referred to as BF, type I to insert, similar to VIM bindings. From that point on everything you do will be recored for the BF program. To leave insert mode simply type I again. 
Use the arrow keys: 
  - Up=increment, 
  - Down=Decrement, 
  - Left=Move Pointer left, 
  - Right=Move Pointer right

Alpha mode is accessed through typing a when insert mode is active, and it will display the ASCII value of the tape for each Cell.
